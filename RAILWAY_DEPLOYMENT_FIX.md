# üöÄ Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## The Problem
The error you encountered was caused by invalid JSON format in the environment variables for list fields like `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CORS_ORIGINS`. Pydantic Settings expects JSON format with double quotes, not Python list format with single quotes.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

1. **Fixed the environment variable format:**
   - Changed `['value1', 'value2']` to `["value1", "value2"]`
   - This ensures proper JSON parsing by Pydantic

2. **Generated secure keys:**
   - Created strong random keys for `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
   - These are critical for security in production

## üîß How to Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Copy Environment Variables
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Select your FileCraft project
3. Click on the **Variables** tab
4. Copy each variable from `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.txt` file one by one

### Step 2: Update Domain-Specific Variables
Replace these variables with your actual Railway domain:

```bash
# Replace "filecraft" with your actual Railway app name
ALLOWED_HOSTS=["your-app-name.up.railway.app", "*.railway.app"]
CORS_ORIGINS=["https://your-app-name.up.railway.app"]
```

### Step 3: Add Database Service (if needed)
If your app uses a database:
1. In Railway dashboard, click **+ New**
2. Select **Database** ‚Üí **PostgreSQL**
3. Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL`

### Step 4: Add Redis Service (if using Celery)
If your app uses Celery for background tasks:
1. In Railway dashboard, click **+ New**  
2. Select **Database** ‚Üí **Redis**
3. Railway will automatically set `REDIS_URL`

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
2. Railway should automatically detect changes and redeploy
3. Check the deployment logs for any issues

## üîë Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: The generated keys in `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.txt` are examples. For maximum security:

1. **Generate new keys** using the `generate-keys.py` script
2. **Never commit** these keys to version control
3. **Only set them** in Railway's environment variables UI
4. **Rotate keys** regularly in production

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check environment variable format**: Ensure all list variables use double quotes
2. **Verify domain names**: Make sure CORS origins match your actual Railway domain
3. **Review logs**: Check Railway deployment logs for specific errors
4. **Test locally**: Run the app locally with the same environment variables

## üìù Files Created/Modified

1. `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.txt` - Environment variables for Railway
2. `.env.production` - Fixed JSON format for list variables
3. `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - This guide

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. Copy variables from `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.txt` to Railway
2. Update domain-specific variables
3. Redeploy your application
4. Test the deployment

Your Railway deployment should now work without the JSON parsing error!
